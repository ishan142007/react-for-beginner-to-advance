1)react is library made by facebook for frontend development.We can create the react project by two to three libraries first by create-react-app or by vite (you can see the vite command on vite website )and by parcel as well.

2)we have to clean the project first in that we can remove all the stuff that is not usefulor we cant understand it .

3)we have to read the json file to know all the dependencies and stuff and also to the command to run the server.
4)in react only functions return html with the only one tag returned at a time so we have to wrap all the html tags in a single tag and also this tag is know as fragment tag.
5)we can make our own file and use return it in the server but for that we need to import it first and export the function by command (export default function name ) then we can show it .
6)there is a naming convention in this first in vite you have to create the new file with .jsx extention and the function name should be capitalized before using .
7)the function used are also know as components 
8)best practices:-
function name should be capital
file name should be capitalized too.
